    <p class="project-intro">
      Guildhall Yard, a historic civic space, is temporarily filled with performance and soundscapes to re-enact memories of its past. Theatre, costume, and sound are intrinsically linked to the site, reflecting Guildhall Yard's origins atop a Roman amphitheatre, and its significance as the ceremonial centre for the Livery Companies of London. Movement of the body, costume, and sound unite through performance to evoke the erased memories of the yard, bringing to life the histories that have since been wiped clean; a tabula rasa.
